  abstract = {A unified approach is given for constructing cross entropy and dissimilarity
	measures between probability distributions, based on a given entropy
	function or a diversity measure. Special properties of quadratic
	entropy introduced by Rao [7] are described. In particular it is
	shown that the square root of the Jensen difference (dissimilarity
	measure) arising out of a quadratic entropy provides a metric on
	a probability space. Several characterizations of quadratic entropy
	are obtained.},
